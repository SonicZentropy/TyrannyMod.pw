## User's Guide
Patchwork is a program that allows you to mod certain games using mod files made by others.
Repository: https://github.com/GregRos/Patchwork

### Requirements
Patchwork is a Mono/.NET application and so needs the .NET Framework or Mono to run.

* **Windows:** [.NET Framework 4.5+](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653) 
* **Linux and Mac:** [Mono 4.2.1.102+](http://www.mono-project.com/download/)

### Instructions

Using the program is straight-forward:

1. Extract it into an **empty** folder.

2. Launch the program (`PatchworkLauncher.exe`)
   
   **Note:** On Linux, you may need to open the program using  `mono` explicitly (see instructions on running Mono applications in your distribution).

3. Specify your game folder in the dialog box or type it in the textbox.

   **Note:** The dialog box will not display hidden files or folders.

4. Go to the *Active Mods* menu and add the mod file(s) (usually ending with `.pw.dll`) to the list of mods, checking those you want enabled.
 
   **Note:** Mod files so chosen will normally be copied to the `Mods` folder.

5. Use *Launch with Mods* and *Launch without Mods* to start the game.
